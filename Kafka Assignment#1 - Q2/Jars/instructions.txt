- hadoop jar  /home/cloudera/FriendsOfFriends.jar FriendsOfFriends data.txt friendsOfFriends P1
- Make sure that the output hdfs file doesn't exist before, so remove it after its creation

To show the result content:
- hadoop fs -cat friendsOfFriends/part-r-00000

To remove data file from HDFS:
- hadoop fs -rm -r /user/cloudera/friendsOfFriends

To copy the result from HDFS to local storage:
- hadoop fs -copyToLocal friendsOfFriends/part-r-00000

To list the content inside a HDFS folder:
- hadoop fs -ls friendsOfFriends
